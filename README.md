Drug Recommendation based on drug details and Optimization using Bee Algorithm

Background

  In an effort to bolster the healthcare system in Thailand, particularly in remote areas, this study focuses on developing a drug recommender system designed to aid physicians in making informed drug recommendations, especially in hospitals where pharmacists may be unavailable. Utilizing drug data sourced from 1mg.com, comprising approximately 34,284 drug entries, the proposed recommender system is constructed employing cosine similarity techniques. Prior to implementing cosine similarity, the data undergoes a meticulous preprocessing phase, including null value imputation and feature extraction using TF-IDF techniques. The subsequent implementation of this system holds the potential to significantly enhance the quality of drug recommendations in remote areas of Thailand.

The final outcome of a drug recommendation system is to optimize the grouping of drugs to minimize the total cost of the drugs. This is done by calculating the fitness of each drug group. The higher the fitness value, the better the drug group. When the optimization is complete, the output is the best drug group, which has the highest fitness value and the lowest total cost of the drugs output of solution.
