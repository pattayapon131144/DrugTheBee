Drug Recommendation based on drug details and Optimization using Bee Algorithm
In an effort to bolster the healthcare system in Thailand, particularly in remote areas, this study focuses on developing a drug recommender system designed to aid physicians in making informed drug recommendations, especially in hospitals where pharmacists may be unavailable. Utilizing drug data sourced from 1mg.com, comprising approximately 34,284 drug entries, the proposed recommender system is constructed employing cosine similarity techniques. Prior to implementing cosine similarity, the data undergoes a meticulous preprocessing phase, including null value imputation and feature extraction using TF-IDF techniques. The subsequent implementation of this system holds the potential to significantly enhance the quality of drug recommendations in remote areas of Thailand.
